   * 1 No need to find all subscriptions and assign them into variable ,  and then use variables to unsubscribe
   * with simple words we donâ€™t need to keep and remember references to our subscriptions anymore
   * 2 No need of third party libraries
   * 3 No need to implement all the time ngOnDestroy
